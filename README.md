# 01 Project - React Online Shop - Hoops and Hops

## Overview

Welcome to my Hoops & Hops e-commerce website! This project is designed to showcase a user-friendly home page for an online store specializing in basketball-related products. The home page features a clean layout with a heading and a list of various basketball products available for purchase.

Each product listing includes an accompanying image, the product's name, a brief description, a "Buy" button with the price, and other essential information. Here's an example screenshot of how a product listing looks:
